Briefly explain why you included the operations you did and why you feel they are a sufficient
interface to a graph. If your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional classes and why you decided
not to include them.

My design includes one interface that is Map, because I think using Map is sufficient to create a
graph that depicts the campus map, if we are not considering sorting algorithms that might need
a SortedMap.
I included AddNode and RemoveNode which allow clients to add a node to and remove a node from the
map. I also included AddEdge and RemoveEdge that works in the same manner but for edges between
a pair of connected nodes. Additionally, I include ListChildren and ListParents methods to compute
what a particular node is connected to and from.

What was your testing strategy for this assignment? How do your script tests and JUnit tests
differ from each other (if they do), and why?

In my script tests, I separately test each method with only few commands as opposed to
multiple interconnected commands. For example, the script test for AddNode only tests
for adding a single Node at a time and nothing else. My JUnit tests differ from the script
tests because in each individual test method in JUnit tests, I included multiple calls where
one method from UnivMap is called followed by some other methods from UnivMap, as a way to
make sure the methods can work in a more general scenario, such as how the state of the
map changes after adding and removing a Node.
