# DesignMap listing children nodes testing file.
# Tests that a list of destination nodes from a given node can be computed

# Create a graph
created graph map1

# Add a number of edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in map1
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in map1
added edge e3 from n3 to n4 in map1
added edge e4 from n4 to n1 in map1

# Add another group of edges
added edge f1 from m1 to m2 in map1
added edge f2 from m2 to m3 in map1
added edge f3 from m3 to m4 in map1
added edge f4 from m4 to m1 in map1

# Finds the children of node n1
the children of n1 in map1 are: n2(e1)

# Finds the children of node m4
the children of m4 in map1 are: m1(f4)
