# DesignMap listing children nodes testing file.
# Tests that a list of destination nodes from a given node can be computed

# Create a graph
created graph map1

# Add a pair of edges
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in map1
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in map1
added edge e4 from n2 to n1 in map1
added edge e3 from n2 to n1 in map1

# Finds the children of node n1
the children of n1 in map1 are: n2(e1 e2)

# Finds the children of node n2
the children of n2 in map1 are: n1(e3 e4)
