# DesignMap listing children nodes testing file.
# Tests that a list of child nodes from a given node can be computed
# where the given node has multiple children, each with multiple edges

# Create a graph
created graph map1

# Add a pair of edges between n1 and n3
added edge f2 from n1 to n3 in map1
added edge f1 from n1 to n3 in map1
added edge f4 from n3 to n1 in map1
added edge f3 from n3 to n1 in map1

# Add a pair of edges between n1 and n2
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in map1
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in map1
added edge e4 from n2 to n1 in map1
added edge e3 from n2 to n1 in map1

# Finds the children of node n1
the children of n1 in map1 are: n2(e1 e2) n3(f1 f2)
